        Big data is often referred as a problem of dealing with large data sets.
        With the advancements in computational science and the recent evolution of
        Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning, huge volumes of data are
        being generated every day. Simultaneously the computational resources needed
        to process and analyze this data is trying to catch up with the rapidly growing
        data and for the most part have succeeded. In today's world, there is a large
        dependency on Neural networks for dealing with problems in AI and Data analysis.
        Big data and its applications can be used to address various issues that arise
        with Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)

    abstract: Big data refers to a problem of dealing with huge volumes of data. With the increase in the amount of data generated every day from various fields, it is becoming extremely hard to store and process this data efficiently. Artificial Intelligence is a research field aiming at replicating human work through machines. Computer vision refers to a research area within AI dealing with training computers to recognize certain subjects of interest. With the exponential growth of AI and computer vision in the recent years, there is need to address the big data problem associated with it.

    title: Big Data Analytics on Influencers in Social Networks
    abstract: >
       Social Networking has become a part of people's lives with millions
of posts made every day. This huge volume of data paves the way to find interesting insights from data. Applying Big Data analytic methods on Twitter data helps in identifying the most influenced users.The Twitter data used for analysis is taken from Kaggle website. Performing feature selection tasks on this data has helped in identifying the important features that differentiate a user's influence over the other. By applying various Machine learning classification algorithms iteratively on these features obtained can be used to classify a user as more influential over the other.
