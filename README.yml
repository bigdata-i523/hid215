        Big data is often referred as a problem of dealing with large data sets.
        With the advancements in computational science and the recent evolution of
        Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Machine Learning, huge volumes of data are
        being generated every day. Simultaneously the computational resources needed
        to process and analyze this data is trying to catch up with the rapidly growing
        data and for the most part have succeeded. In today's world, there is a large
        dependency on Neural networks for dealing with problems in AI and Data analysis.
        Big data and its applications can be used to address various issues that arise
        with Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)
